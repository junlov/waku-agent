"""Reset .waku to a clean, curated state for a demo / recording.

    python scripts/demo_seed.py

What it does (your old state is backed up first, never just deleted):
  1. moves the current .waku aside to .waku.bak-<timestamp>
  2. creates a fresh state.db + calendar.ics
  3. seeds a small, clean memory (a few facts + one episode) and ONE calendar
     event — Sergey's standing Saturday 5 PM swim
  4. leaves traces/, outbox/ and the chat log EMPTY, so when you type live on
     camera the loop, traces and Gateway inbox fill up in front of the viewer

Everything it writes is the same data the app writes — open state.db afterwards
and it looks exactly like real use, just tidy.
